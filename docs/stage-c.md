# Stage C — live trap-layer bring-up

Stage C runs the original resident `CODE` segments and advances one loud stop at a time. The
acceptance boundary is still the game's own intro pixels; this document records the standalone
port's execution order, which is now known to differ from the earlier MAME first-use table.

## Current checkpoint

With one debugger-forced intro click, the Amiga run executes **65 distinct successful-path traps**
and continues for a three-minute warp run without entering the game's error dialog or reaching an
unimplemented trap. The production `Button` implementation reads the Amiga CIA left-button bit—the
forced click exists only in diagnostic builds used to cross the intro wait.

An earlier run appeared to advance through `GetDItem`, `SetIText`, `InsetRect`, and
`FrameRoundRect`. That was a false branch: the fixed four-entry `GWorldSlot` table filled while
Exec still had ample memory, so the fifth `NewGWorld` returned `memFullErr`. The game translated
that into error ID 04, "NewGWorld error, Offscreen allocation error," and opened dialog 700. The
table now has capacity for all six simultaneously live offscreen worlds. Those four error-dialog-
only traps are deliberately unimplemented again, so a regression stops at `GetDItem` and exposes
the upstream failure instead of teaching the port to render it.

The successful first-use order is:

1. `BlockMove`
2. `UnLoadSeg`
3. `GetResource`
4. `InitGraf`
5. `InitFonts`
6. `InitWindows`
7. `InitMenus`
8. `TEInit`
9. `InitDialogs`
10. `InitCursor`
11. `GetToolTrapAddress`
12. `NewPtrSysClear`
13. `OpenResFile`
14. `MaxApplZone`
15. `FreeMem`
16. `GetPort`
17. `SysEnvirons`
18. `GetGDevice`
19. `MoveHHi`
20. `HLock`
21. `CurResFile`
22. `UseResFile`
23. `NewPtrClear`
24. `GetNewCWindow`
25. `MoveWindow`
26. `SetPort`
27. `GetNewPalette`
28. `GetCTSeed`
29. `SetPalette`
30. `ActivatePalette`
31. `ShowWindow`
32. `SelectWindow`
33. `BeginUpdate`
34. `EndUpdate`
35. `TextMode`
36. `GetCursor`
37. `SetCursor`
38. `GetNewDialog`
39. `DrawDialog`
40. `QDExtensions` (`NewGWorld`, `LockPixels`, and `NoPurgePixels` selectors now exercised)
41. `RecoverHandle`
42. `Delay`
43. `NewPtrSys`
44. `VInstall`
45. `NewHandle`
46. `HUnlock`
47. `GetTrapAddress`
48. `SetTrapAddress`
49. `GetHandleSize`
50. `PtrAndHand`
51. `GetNamedResource`
52. `HNoPurge`
53. `CmpString` / `EqualString`
54. `SetHandleSize`
55. `DisposeDialog`
56. `GetPicture`
57. `DrawPicture`
58. `PenSize`
59. `PenMode`
60. `FrameRect`
61. `CopyBits`
62. `EraseRect`
63. `ClipRect`
64. `Button`
65. `HPurge`

`amiga/stage_c.gdb` watches the loud-stop state transition and prints the depth, trap identity,
selector, runtime `(segment, offset)`, absolute PC, USP, all data/address registers, and nearby
instructions. The expanded report matters now that Macintosh support code copied into movable
memory is calling traps outside the 11 resident `CODE` ranges. The build's `muldiv-audit` and
`probe-audit` are clean.

## Page 0 is not mapped

Macintosh low-memory globals overlap the Amiga's exception vectors and Exec state, so mapping or
copying the lowest 32 KiB is not an option. `tools/m68k_lowmem.py` follows all 509 `CODE 0`
entries and currently finds **108 reachable absolute references to 17 distinct Page-0 locations**.

The port handles them as semantic globals. Each executed absolute-short instruction is first
validated against its shipped opcode, then rewritten at the same width to an A5-relative shadow:

| Mac global | Macintosh address | shadow | first consumer |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `RndSeed` | `$0156` | `4(A5)` | `Main+$0570` |
| `WMgrPort` | `$09DE` | `8(A5)` | `Main+$08A6` |
| `GrayRgn` | `$09EE` | `12(A5)` | `Initialize+$08C4` |

This preserves the original code flow without touching Amiga low memory. More shadows are added
only when execution reaches them; the inventory shows that most remaining references are `Ticks`,
mouse/key state, and repeated `GrayRgn` reads.

## Resource and handle boundary

The host converter packs both resource forks into the pointer-free, big-endian `VRS1` archive.
The target Resource Manager searches the selected fork and returns real double-indirect Handles.
Archive payloads are permanently resident: `MoveHHi` validates such a handle but needs no physical
relocation, while `HLock`/`HUnlock` record lock state. The emulated heap now also owns real movable
Handles: `NewHandle` creates a stable master pointer, `GetHandleSize` reports the logical payload,
and `PtrAndHand` grows and appends while updating that master pointer. `RecoverHandle` covers both
heap allocations and resident resource payloads. `OpenResFile` performs classic case-insensitive
filename matching, which matters because the shipped Pascal name is `Vette!.DATA`.

The copied support code also installs a `VBLTask`. `VInstall` maintains the classic linked task
records. The callback cannot be invoked directly from Amiga's supervisor-mode VERTB ISR: a Line-A
trap made there has a different exception/USP context from the user-mode frame expected by the
bridge. Delivery therefore belongs at a later user-mode scheduling point, not inside the hardware
interrupt.

## Window and palette state

The Window Manager now builds `CWindowRecord`s from the shipped `WIND` resources, maintains the
window chain, places and shows windows, switches the current port, and brackets updates. One early
address-error run caught a pool header that made `WindowRecord` addresses odd; records now begin at
offset zero in an even-aligned slot. `WMgrPort` is intentionally an old-style `GrafPort`: the game
reads its embedded `BitMap` bounds directly when centering windows.

`GetNewPalette` loads the shipped `pltt` resource as a Handle. `SetPalette` associates it with a
window, and `ActivatePalette` copies its 16 `RGBColor` entries into the active color table with a
fresh seed. Cursor resources likewise remain Handles until the game dereferences and installs one.

`GetNewDialog` now builds the `DialogRecord` from the shipped `DLOG`/`DITL` pair and `DrawDialog`
validates the item stream, selects the dialog port, and paints its background. `GetDItem` walks that
stream and materializes movable text handles for static-text items; `SetIText` resizes and fills them.
Offscreen QuickDraw allocates a real 4-bit `GWorld`/`PixMap` and pixel store; selectors 0, 1, and 12
are respectively `NewGWorld`, `LockPixels`, and `NoPurgePixels`.

The scoped PICT interpreter now handles the measured v2 4-bit and 8-bit indexed `PackBitsRect`, v1
1-bit `PackBitsRect`, and component-packed 32-bit `DirectBitsRect` paths. It maps embedded/direct RGB
through the active 16-color table. `CopyBits` supports the measured `srcCopy` and `srcBic` transfers,
including scaling, overlap safety, and the current rectangular clip; unsupported opcodes and modes
still fall through to the loud stop.

The trap-address table is stateful. The observed `GetTrapAddress`/`SetTrapAddress` pair now records
the game's replacement for `$A9F4 ExitToShell`; routing a later invocation through that replacement
remains part of completing the trap bridge.

## Correction to the MAME log

The 51-row MAME table is a measurement of that reference run, not fabricated data, but the live
standalone path has already called setup traps missing from or much later in its first-use order.
Therefore the table's 36-trap intro count is a **floor**, not the standalone implementation total.
The reason for the tracer omission remains to be audited; Stage C uses its own loud stop as the
authoritative work queue meanwhile.
